Svelte-AlertNotify is a svelte component made to display cool alerts or notifications

  - Creation of alert or notification is really simple with the bunch of method provided
  - A lite weight component with SVG as default images for notifications
  - Stylisable at will with all the parameter you can pass and the choice of localisation in webpages of the notifications or the alerts
  - Use of the svelte store to maintain data
